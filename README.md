Netflix Data: Cleaning, Analysis and Visualization
About Dataset
Netflix is a popular streaming service that offers a vast catalog of movies, TV shows,
and original contents. This dataset is a cleaned version of the original version which
can be found here. The data consist of contents added to Netflix from 2008 to 2021.
The oldest content is as old as 1925 and the newest as 2021. This dataset will be
cleaned with PostgreSQL and visualized with Tableau. The purpose of this dataset is to
test my data cleaning and visualization skills.
Data Cleaning
We are going to:
1. Treat the Nulls
2. Treat the duplicates
3. Populate missing rows
4. Drop unneeded columns
5. Split columns
Netflix Data: Cleaning, Analysis, and Visualization
This project involves loading, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data from a Netflix
dataset. We'll use Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to work
through the project. The goal is to explore the dataset, derive insights, and prepare
for potential machine learning tasks.
Step 1: Import Required Libraries
Step 2: Load the Dataset
Step 3: Data Cleaning
Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Step 5: Conclusion and Insights
In this project, we:
1. Cleaned the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and
converting data types.
2. Explored the data through various visualizations such as bar plots and word
clouds.
3. Analyzed content trends over time, identified popular genres, and highlighted
top directors.
Step 6: Next Steps
1. Feature Engineering: Create new features, such as counting the number of
genres per movie or extracting the duration in minutes.
2. Machine Learning: Use the cleaned and processed data to build models for
recommendations or trend predictions.
3. Advanced Visualization: Use interactive plots or dashboards for more detailed
analysis.
